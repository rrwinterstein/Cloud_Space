# Cloud Space

![Dashboard mockup](/images/dashboard-mockup.png)

This repo consists of a brief case study and assets for the design and development for Cloud Space. Below you can find links to the full prototype and the landing page and dashboard built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Keep in mind, not all links or actions may be clickable as it is a partial build to understand how the site and user dashboard function.

## Case Study

### Overview

Cloud Space is an online-based application that allows users to save information from online sources or by uploading their own content. This content can be saved and accessed for individual use or for teams to share and collaborate.

### The Problem

There are a number of services that are offered to store information and share with others but typically charge extra to do so. And the number of different services offered makes it tough to figure out which ones is best for the user. During user research, it became clear that most people who are trying to save information they see online are not aware of the best way to do so or find issues with the current method they are using. It seemed that many platforms were used to save websites as bookmarks. Some used the bookmark feature within their browser while others used sites such as Pinterest or Pocket to save links and reference them later on.

### The Solution

Cloud Space will allow users to save information from online or by uploading content, creating content within the service itself, and share and collaborate with others. It will act as a “one-stop-shop” for any users needs without having to use multiple platforms to accomplish several tasks. Users will be able to save links or bookmarks and sort them easily within folders. In addition, notes can be created within Cloud Space and sorting them based on preference such as category or alphabetically. Images can also be saved or uploaded and sorted.

### The Process

My role for Cloud Space was UX/UI Designer as well as building a landing page for the service. This consisted of designing and maintaining all assets for the application including branding guidelines, logo design, wireframing and full screen mockups with prototypes. Surveys and user tests were conducted to ensure the user flows made sense and everything in the design was meaningful to the user.

### The Conclusion

From the start of research to deployment of the site, total time spent on the project was just over four full work weeks (2-3 days per week for 4 months). The implementation of the final design was able to be executed perfectly without compromising any aspects or functionality. If additional time could be used on the project, I would have liked to redesign the dashboard layout.

Many tools were used in creating Cloud Space and many areas were new to me. During this project I was able to learn concepts in user experience, surveying and research, user interface design, prototyping, and web development. Not only learning these concepts but understanding the reasoning behind why each one is done and the order in which they are done have be extremely helpful for how I  layout, plan and allocate time for future projects.
